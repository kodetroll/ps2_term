This is an Atmel AVR ATTiny4313 based serial terminal using a PS2 Keyboard and
a 16X2 LCD display. This project is designed to work with the Futurlec ET-JRAVR
development board. It includes two libraries, Peter Fluery' LCD Library and Jurre Hanema's PS2 Keyboard library. Both of these libraries have been 
hacked in order to work with this application. The LCD library need to be modified in order to take the Futurlec LCD derps into account. Information on connecting the hardware is contained in the main module ps2_term.c
